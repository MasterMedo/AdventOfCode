# AdventOfCode '15-'17
All years in various programming languages

bash, c, c++, C#, Go, haskell, J, java, javascript, K, perl, python, R, ruby, rust

## The idea

I only heard of the AoC challenge in November 2017. Thrilled by the idea I decided to do all previous AoC's retrospectively with the 2017 one. The reddit suggested trying out different programming languages so that's what I'll be focusing on with the AoC 2015 and 2016.

AoC 2017 will mostly be done in C# and python since those are my main programming languages at the moment.

In each repository you can find the table of currently finished tasks.
