# advent of code

### python only branch

In 2015 I focused primarily on learning the quirks of python.
Most of the code there are oneliners, sometimes even readable ones.
There's a lot of switching back and forth between python 2 and 3.
Took me a while to transition completely.

The focus now is writing concise and succint code.
