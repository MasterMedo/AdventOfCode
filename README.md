# AdventOfCode '15-'17
All years in various programming languages

c, c++, C#, haskell, J, java, javascript, K, perl, python

## The idea

I only heard of the AoC challenge in November 2017. Thrilled by the idea I decided to do all previous AoC's retrospectively with the 2017 one. The reddit suggested trying out different programming languages so that's what I'll be focusing on.

In each repository you can find the table of currently finished tasks.

AoC 2017 will mostly be done in python and C# since those are my main programming languages at the moment.
